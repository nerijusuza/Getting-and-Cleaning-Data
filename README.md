#Getting and Cleaning Data
##Course Project

1. You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following
2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
6. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

##Steps to execute the R code

1. Dowload run_analysis.R and save it to your working directory
2. Open it in RStudio and run it
3. R script will create a new folder called Data
4. It will download archived data, unzip, read all necessary files
5. It will give an output named tidydata.txt which will be saved in Data folder
